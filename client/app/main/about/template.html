				<h2 class="lead">Hi, I'm Reza</h2>

				<p>It was my goal to get stories a chance to be heard. I myself had some particular stories that were appreciated at the highest echelons (i.e. A.F.I.), yet they were <i>never</i> going to be appreciated to a significant level by status-quo institutions, including "beneficent" and "evidence based" ones such as U.C.L.A. I found it profoundly sad the stories that society <u>needed</u> to hear were not going to be "approved", and not going to be performed or aired at any theatre, album, book, or other format their message to get across.</p>

				<p>In response, I started engaging in the space of open source technologies and applying them to media. Software in this family includes the amazing <a href="https://www.blender.org/" target="_blank">Blender 3D</a>, and pretty much everything that results in the development of this web service.</p>


				<p>I've been writing this software (part time on my own on the side) in one shape, way, or form since 2013. It was once published as a Tinder-like match making iPhone app in 2014 (called Prod√ºsus back then), existed in various forms, and now it's grown to a mature and flexible platform to handle a variety of needs for professional and non-professional artists to collaborate and make stuff happen. </p>

				<p>Today, the open source media community that has been influenced by this mission is about 5,000 strong in the Los Angeles area. This includes previous engagements with the Los Angeles Blender 3D community and other communities of people who make things happen with open source software and democratized technologies such as cameras and gear.</p>

				<p>The mission of this project is to give people the opportunity to tell their stories, and for communities to come together and open dialog between them. The result of using this system is to protect the rights of content makers in the digital age while making the creation process more seamless.</p>
