		                    <div>
		                        <p>
		                            Most of our Terms of Use explain your relationship with Open Source Hollywood. This section is different — it explains the relationship between <b>authors, talents, resources and the public</b> of Open Source Hollywood campaigns, and who’s responsible for what composes our system. This is what you’re agreeing to when you become involved in an Open Source Hollywood campaign.
		                        </p>
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                        <p>
		                            Open Source Hollywood provides a revenue sharing and performance accountability platform for creative campaigns. When an author posts a campaign on Open Source Hollywood, they’re inviting other people to form contracts with them. Anyone who attains any form of interest in a campaign is accepting the negotiated final offer that is in the discussions between the offeror and offeree.
		                        </p>
		                        <p>
		                            Open Source Hollywood is not a part of this contract — the contract is a direct legal agreement between the parties and the campaign. Here are the terms that govern that agreement:
		                        </p>
		                    </div>
		                    <div class="rounded bg-violet-light p3 p5-sm mt3 mt5-sm mb3 mb5-sm" id="backer-author">
		                        <p>
		                            Only qualified candidates are eligible to issue interests in the future revenues of campaigns. Authors may attain qualification by voluntarily participating in a background screening that costs $5000 per legal entity. Otherwise, authors are expected to establish a record of performance and trust with our algorithms to become eligible to issue interests in a campaign. The metrics of performance include: fulfillment of merchandise sales, participation or creation of campaigns, completion of campaigns, positive reviews from campaign team members, and others.
		                        </p>
		                        <p>
		                            Once a campaign equity structure is defined it cannot be changed.
		                        </p>
		                        <p>
		                            A campaign is eligible for issuing interests in the future earnings. The portion of revenues is determined by a percentage that the user sets aside for public sales or issuance. The portion becomes eligible for purchase as "shares", and these entitle the purchaser of the shares to a portion of the earnings revenues corresponding to the percentage defined by the author when the campaign equity structure was issued.
		                        </p>
		                        <p>
		                            The "shares" represent revenue interests only. It does not entitle the purchaser to other monetizations of the campaign including and not limited to licensing and others.
		                        </p>
		                        <p>
		                            The purchasers of "shares" in the revenue interests of campaigns must be registered users.
		                        </p>
		                        <p>
		                            The revenues generated is determined by the Honor Code or by third-party distribution partners that provide this data. Authors must agree to share the distributions data related to their campaign for the purposes of analyzing, collecting, and distributing funds.
		                        </p>
		                        <p>
		                            When an applicant offers a donation for a role <b>the author must fulfill their promise to reward that role</b> in order to receive the funds. Once an author has accepted the applicant to their campaign, they’ve satisfied their promise and are eligible to receive the donation.
		                        </p>
		                        <p>
		                            When a merchandise is sold, <b>the author must complete the fulfillment of that purchase</b>. Shipment fees, costs, and damages are fully the responsibility of the seller.
		                        </p>
		                        <p>
		                            Campaign donations or purchasing merchandise does not require registration. Anyone in the eligible public is able to donate funds to a campaign or make purchases for merchandise without the need to register.
		                        </p>
		                        <p>
		                            Throughout the process, authors owe their backers a high standard of effort, honest communication, and a dedication to bringing the campaign to life. At the same time, backers must understand that when they back a campaign, they’re helping to create something new. There may be changes or delays, and there’s a chance something could happen that prevents the author from being able to finish the campaign as promised.
		                        </p>
		                        <p>
		                            If an author is unable to complete their campaign, they’ve failed to live up to the basic obligations of this agreement. To right this, they must make every reasonable effort to find another way of bringing the campaign to the best possible conclusion for backers. A author in this position has only remedied the situation and met their obligations to backers if:
		                        </p>
		                        <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
		                            <li>they post an update that explains what work has been done, how funds were used, and what prevents them from finishing the campaign as planned;</li>
		                            <li>they work diligently and in good faith to bring the campaign to the best possible conclusion in a timeframe that’s communicated to backers;</li>
		                            <li>they’re able to demonstrate that they’ve used funds appropriately and made every reasonable effort to complete the campaign as promised; and</li>
		                            <li>they’ve been honest, and have made no material misrepresentations in their communication to backers.</li>
		                        </ul>
		                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
		                        <p>
		                            The author is solely responsible for fulfilling the promises made in their campaign. If they’re unable to satisfy the terms of this agreement, they may be subject to legal action by backers. Further, they will have points deducted from their score, thus, making it less likely for them to run successful campaigns in the future.

We reserve the right to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to this indemnification clause, in which case you agree that you’ll cooperate and help us in asserting any defenses.

		                            We at Open Source Hollywood encourage you to contact us if you’re having an issue, before resorting to the courts. In the unfortunate situation where legal action does arise, these Terms (and all other rules, policies, or guidelines incorporated by reference) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California and the United States, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law, and without application of the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act or the United Nations Convention of Controls for International Sale of Goods. You agree that Open Source Hollywood and its Services are deemed a passive website that does not give rise to jurisdiction over Open Source Hollywood or its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, assigns, employees, agents, directors, officers, or shareholders, either specific or general, in any jurisdiction other than the State of California. You agree that any action at law or in equity arising out of or relating to these Terms, or your use or non-use of Open Source Hollywood, shall be filed only in the state or federal courts located in California County in the State of California, and you hereby consent and submit to the personal jurisdiction of these courts for the purposes of litigating any such action. You hereby irrevocably waive any right you may have to trial by jury in any dispute, action, or proceeding.

		                            These Terms and the other material referenced in them are the entire agreement between you and Open Source Hollywood with respect to the Services. They supersede all other communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and Open Source Hollywood with respect to the Services and govern our future relationship. If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid under the law, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms otherwise will remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The failure of either you or Open Source Hollywood to exercise any right provided for in these Terms in any way won’t be deemed a waiver of any other rights.

Open Source Hollywood has the right to assign, transfer, or delegate any of its rights and obligations under these Terms without your consent. Open Source Hollywood will provide you notice via email, written notice, or by conspicuously posting the notice on our Site.
